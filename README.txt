NodeMap is a Google Chrome extension that maps a page's DOM
structure in a graphical interface.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Current issues:
    - The node map is way too big for most pages

Next steps:
    - Draw lines between nodes
    - Add controls to resize the entire node map
    - Add functionality to view each node's attributes

How to use:
    1. Load NodeMap as an unpacked extension in Google Chrome
    2. Open any web page, online or offline
    3. Click the NodeMap icon to display the page's DOM
